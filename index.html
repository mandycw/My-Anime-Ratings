                Your Name is a very popular anime movie that features a boy and a girl that swap bodies from time to time. The body-switching trope is very popular and usually comedic. Your Name takes this trope and puts a very emotional twist on it. The story starts off with one of the two main characters, Mitsuha who lives in a rural town in Japan. Bored with her life, she wishes to be a Tokyo boy in her next life. Unexpectedly, her wish comes true and she switches bodies with Taki, a high school boy that lives in Tokyo. They wake up as each other some days and must live through the other's respective duties and social interactions for the day. When the body-switching unexpectedly ends, Taki is determined to find Mitsuha but does not know the name of her town. He relies on his sketches of the town and even so, still struggles to find a person who recognizes it. With amazing visuals and soundtrack, this movie undoubtedly earns a 10/10.

        <h4 class="name">2. <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/spy-x-family">SPY x FAMILY</a></h4>
        <h4 class="rating">9/10 ⭐</h4>

            <p>
                SPY x FAMILY is a very recently released anime. In order to maintain the state of peace between two rivlaing nations, Westalis and Ostania, a spy with the codename of "Twilight", is tasked to spy on Donovan Desmond, leader of the National Unity Party within Ostania. However, due to Desmond being notoriously reclusive, the only way Twilight can get close to him is to enroll a child in the same private school as Desmond's son and pose as their father. To accomplish this, he creates the alias of Loid Forger, adopts a young orphan girl named Anya, and marries a woman named Yor Briar, to create the image of a happy family. However, Yor is in fact a professional assassin, with neither her nor Loid being aware of each other's true identities. Both of them are also unaware that Anya can read minds, and knows their true professions. Despite these unknown factors, Loid must learn to play the role of the perfect father and husband in order to carry out his mission. This spy themed anime has been very anticipated and very well recieved by the public. Only four episodes are out so far but the Forger family has already captured everyone's hearts, especially Anya, the cutest child to ever exist. Perhaps the reason we like this anime so much is because we actually get to see what a loving family looks like.

        <h4 class="name"> 3. <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/death-note">Death Note</a></h4>
        <h4 class="rating">8/10 ⭐</h4>
        <p>
            In Tokyo, a disaffected high-school student named Light Yagami finds the "Death Note", a mysterious black notebook that can kill anyone as long as the user knows both the target's name and face. Initially terrified of its god-like power, Light considers the possibilities of the Death Note's abilities and kills high-profile Japanese criminals, then targets international criminals. Five days after discovering the notebook, Light is visited by Ryuk, a "Shinigami" and the Death Note's previous owner. Ryuk, invisible to anyone who has not touched the notebook, reveals that he dropped the notebook into the human world out of boredom and is amused by Light's actions. I believe that Death Note can be enjoyed by anyone, even if they do not watch anime. (SPOILERS AHEAD) Although after L dies, the episodes after do get a little boring as the tension between Light and L are gone. Still a very good anime.
